Plugin on [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-recent-posts/)

**Introducing new feature in 0.6.13 version: the embedded video instead of the Post Featured Image**

You can use the embedded video (first movie) instead of the Post Featured Image in Responsive Grid Layout. If you have any ideas about this feature or it work not properly, please write me in special topic on <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/new-feature-in-0613-the-embedded-video-instead-of-the-post-featured-image" target="_blank">Support Forum</a>'

Advanced Recent Posts plugin shows the recent posts with thumbnails in two areas:
* widget in your sidebar
* shortcode in any place of your post or theme.

Customization of the plugin is wery simple an flexible:
* Widgets are configured into Dashboard -> Appearance -> Widgets
* Shortcodes are configured in plugin shortcode builder, you will see it in the admin menu of your WordPress

There are two predefined color schemes (for Basic and Grid layout): dark and light, but you can set up your own scheme. Or use natural images.

Better to see once than read a hundred times - see the [live demo](http://demo.lp-tricks.com/) on my website :)
